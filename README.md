# Introduction
In the United States, a nation of 330 million people, one person is elected to represent the country as its leader. The President of the United States has an incredible amount of power and influence not only in the country, but also the world. Only 45 people have served as President; the first was George Washington, beginning in 1789, while the current President is Donald Trump. These 45 individuals have shaped the history of our country and have led us through some dark and harrowing times. 
I love politics! I read the news every day and follow politics avidly. I pay attention to current political and economic events in the United States as well as in the world. When the idea came to me about creating a database, I immediately became interested in creating one pertaining to politics. After much thought and consideration, I decided to create a detailed and comprehensive database in SQL on the U.S. Presidents. Given that many metrics and figures didn’t start getting recorded until about the 1940s (around Truman’s Presidency), I limited my database to the last 13 presidents. The database includes various metrics such as GDP rates, unemployment rates, approval ratings, and job creation. My intention was to create a non-partisan database, and thus, not include any personal bias or commentary; I was not rooting for any one president or any one party. 
# Summary of Findings
## Age and Experience
Age may be a factor that some people consider when choosing a candidate. Currently, all of the 2020 frontrunners are 70 years of age or above (Donald Trump- 73, Joe Biden- 76, Elizabeth Warren- 70, and Bernie Sanders- 78). Thus, I felt that it was useful to include age in my database. As for the findings, the 3 oldest presidents were Republican (Donald Trump- 70, Ronald Reagan- 69, and George H.W. Bush- 64) while the 3 youngest presidents were Democrats (John F. Kennedy- 43, Bill Clinton- 46, and Barack Obama- 47). The average age for a Republican president was 63 while the average age for a Democrat was 51. Out of the 13 presidents 5 served as vice-president before (H.W. Bush, Nixon, Ford, Johnson, and Truman). 
## Executive Orders and Judicial Appointments
Executive Orders are actions taken by a sitting president in order to bypass Congress. The three Presidents with the most executive orders were Harry Truman (907), Dwight Eisenhower (484), and Ronald Reagan (381). Judicial appointments are one of the most influential parts of a president’s legacy. In particular, since judges on the Supreme Court serve lifetime appointments, a president may have the opportunity to shape the Supreme Court for decades to come. I found that the average Republican president had about 3 (2.86) Supreme Court appointments while the average Democratic president had about 2 (2.0) Supreme Court appointments. 
## Economic Metrics
One of the most common questions asked by people is “Which party presides over a better economy?” I looked at three key economic metrics: average GDP rate, average unemployment rate, and average job growth. I found that in all cases Democratic presidents edged out Republican presidents. The average GDP rate for Democratic presidents was 3.3% while the average for Republicans was 2.74%. The three presidents with the highest GDP rates were all Democrats: Lyndon B. Johnson (5.3%), John F. Kennedy (4.3%), and Bill
Clinton (3.9%). The average unemployment rate for Democrats was 5.58% while the average for Republicans was 5.84%. The presidents with the lowest average unemployment rates
were Donald Trump (4.1%), Harry Truman (4.2%), and Lyndon B. Johnson (4.2%), while those with the highest average unemployment rates were Gerald Ford (7.8%), Ronald Reagan (7.5%), and Barack Obama (7.4%). (Bear in mind that as of this writing President Trump had not completed his term in office). Presidents who served the longest (8 years) tended to have unemployment rates that fluctuated far more than Presidents who didn’t serve as long. Finally, the average job creation percentage for Democrats was 10.3% while the average for Republicans was 7.2%. The presidents who presided over the most job creation were Ronald Reagan (16.5%), Bill Clinton (15.6%), and Harry Truman (13.0%). 
## Approval Ratings
I looked at approval ratings from Gallup Polling, in which it is asked whether Americans approve of the job the President is doing. Gallup is a very reputable non-partisan pollster. I looked at highs, lows, ranges, and the average. Have former U.S. Governors or Senators received higher approval ratings? Some people have argued that being a governor better prepares a candidate to be President due to the executive experience. What I found with respect to Presidential approval ratings is that former Senators tended to have slightly higher approval ratings than Governors (53 versus 51 percent). I wanted to find out if Democrat or Republican presidents have higher average approval ratings. I found that the average Republican approval rating was 52% while the average for Democrat’s was 53%. The three presidents with the highest average approval rating were John F. Kennedy (D-70%), Dwight Eisenhower (R-65%), and George H.W. Bush (R-61%). (Bear in mind that President Kennedy served less than three years.) The presidents with the highest highs were George W. Bush (R- 90%), George H.W. Bush (R- 89%), and Harry Truman (D-87%) while the presidents with the lowest lows were Harry Truman (D-22%), Richard Nixon (R-24%), and George W. Bush (R-25%). The president with the lowest range was Donald Trump (R-11%) while the president with the highest range was George W. Bush (R-65%). President Bush had a peak approval rating in 2001 right after the 9/11 tragedy, with a 90% approval rating. His approval rating plummeted towards the end of his second term when the recession started and the war in the Middle East was continuing. Presidential approval ratings can fluctuate quite a bit depending on various factors. Overall, presidents presiding over more robust economies had higher approval ratings, and presidents who served two full terms tended to have approval ratings with more variance.
## Elections
Finally, I included a variety of information pertaining to presidential elections, such as voter turnout, electoral votes received, and popular vote. Dwight Eisenhower had the highest voter turnout (63.3%) in the 1952 election. The average voter turnout when a Republican or Democrat won was extremely close: 55.9% and  56.1% respectively. 
Ronald Reagan received the most electoral votes (525) in the 1984 election. Republicans, on average, received more electoral votes than Democrats (402 compared to 354). Lyndon B. Johnson had the highest popular vote percentage. He garnered 61.1% of the popular vote in the 1964 election. Republicans, on average, received more of the popular vote than Democrats. The average Republican popular vote percentage was 52.4% while the average Democratic Percentage was 50.8%. The two Presidents who lost the popular vote but won the electoral vote were both Republicans: Donald Trump and George W. Bush.
